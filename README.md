# I Wanted a Cool Website

This is my portfolio website for displaying my collection of projects that I have made through my journy of learning how to program.
With this project I wanted to experiment with TailwindCss, Css has been something ive struggled with and always strive to get better at.
But pure Css is a nightmare, while looking for better solutions for writing Css I stumbled upon TailWind. 
It really fun and easy to style something! 
The one downside is that the HTML can get really bloaded and look really ugly. But for me at least its all worth it to have an easier time with Css.


# Planned Release
I will be releasing the site on 7/16/2022. Once released there will be a link providere here -
